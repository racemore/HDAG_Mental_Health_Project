Overtime, anxiety and depression cases have risen, especially among adolescents and young adults. 
According to the World Health Organization, 20% of adolescents worldwide have a mental 
health condition with depression being one of the most common. Alarmingly, it is reported approximately 264 million people are 
diagnosed with depression worldwide, more commonly for women than men, and among the older population, about 7% have depression. 
Similarly, in the United States, rates of anxiety and depression have increased in the younger population. 
In fact, based on a Pew Research Center survey in 2018, seven in ten students perceive anxiety and depression
as a major problem among their peers. Altogether, anxiety and depression is a major problem worldwide,
affecting people of all ages which can be attributed to environmental pressures such as financial stability and academics.
Moreover, we are interested in observing the rates of anxiety and depression across certain age groups and sex in the
U.S amist the rapid changes in lifestyles and pressure from the global pandemic.
